#Alembic for DB versioning and migrations

##Create a new migration
```alembic revision -m "migration_one"```

This will generate a new migration file in MITuna/alembic/versions
Update this new file with desired upgrades.

##Ugrade or downgrade
```alembic upgrade head```
This will apply DB changes from the latest versioning file

Similarly, to downgrade run:
```alembic downgrade head```

To upgrade or downgrade to/from a specific version:
```alembic upgrade/downgrade <hash>```

Useful commands:
```
alembic history [show command history]
alembic downgrade -1 [Downgrade by 1 version]
alembic stamp <hash> [Move head to a specific hash]
```
